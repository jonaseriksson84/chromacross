Excellent question. You're right to push for more detail here, as the share functionality is a critical part of the game's potential for virality. A confusing or ugly share block will fail completely.

Let me be self-critical first: my previous example was just the final output. It didn't explain *how* the 2D grid on the screen is translated into that specific multi-line text block. The visual interpretation is not obvious.

Let's break it down with clear examples.

### The Goal

The goal is to create a text block that **visually represents the shape of the puzzle** in a compact, spoiler-free way. It needs to look good on Twitter, in a text message, on Discord, etc.

### The Core Problem

How do we represent this 2D grid...

```
      L (ðŸŸ§)
W A T E R (â¬œðŸŸ©ðŸŸ¨ðŸŸ«ðŸŸ¥)
      M (ðŸŸª)
      O (â¬›)
      N (ðŸŸ¦)
```

...as a simple text string?

### Bad Example (And Why It's Bad)

A naive approach would be to just list the emojis for each word:

```
ChromaCross #42 - My Bad Example
Horizontal: â¬œðŸŸ©ðŸŸ¨ðŸŸ«ðŸŸ¥
Vertical: ðŸŸ§ðŸŸ«ðŸŸªâ¬›ðŸŸ¦
```

**Self-Critique:** This is terrible. It completely loses the game's core visual gimmick: the intersection. It tells you the colors, but it doesn't show you the *shape* of the puzzle. There is no "cross" in this `ChromaCross` share text. It's not intriguing.

---

### Good Example (And How to Build It)

The key is to use **standard spaces for alignment** to preserve the cross shape. The process involves building the text line by line.

Let's use our `WATER`/`LEMON` example.

*   **Horizontal Word:** `WATER` (5 letters)
*   **Vertical Word:** `LEMON` (5 letters)
*   **Intersection:** The 'E' is at index 3 of `WATER` and index 1 of `LEMON`.

#### Step 1: Establish the Emoji Mapping

First, your code needs a map from the letters (or their assigned colors) to a specific emoji.

```javascript
// This map is used ONLY for generating the share text.
const emojiMap = {
  W: "â¬œ", A: "ðŸŸ©", T: "ðŸŸ¨", E: "ðŸŸ«", R: "ðŸŸ¥",
  L: "ðŸŸ§", M: "ðŸŸª", O: "â¬›", N: "ðŸŸ¦",
};
```

#### Step 2: Build the Text Line by Line

The logic needs to iterate through the grid conceptually and build each line of the output string.

**Line 1: The top part of the vertical word.**
*   The vertical word is `LEMON`. The part *before* the intersection is `L`.
*   The letter `L` needs to align with the `E` in `WATER`.
*   The `E` is at index 3 of `WATER`. This means we need 3 spaces of padding before we place the emoji for `L`.
*   **Resulting Text:** `"   " + emojiMap['L']` -> `"   ðŸŸ§"`

**Line 2: The full horizontal word.**
*   This is the easiest line. Just map each letter of `WATER` to its emoji.
*   **Resulting Text:** `emojiMap['W'] + emojiMap['A'] + ...` -> `"â¬œðŸŸ©ðŸŸ¨ðŸŸ«ðŸŸ¥"`

**Line 3: The bottom part of the vertical word.**
*   The part of `LEMON` *after* the intersection is `MON`.
*   Each of these letters must also be aligned with the intersection point.
*   So, for each letter, we add 3 spaces of padding.
*   **Resulting Text for 'M':** `"   " + emojiMap['M']` -> `"   ðŸŸª"`
*   **Resulting Text for 'O':** `"   " + emojiMap['O']` -> `"   â¬›"`
*   **Resulting Text for 'N':** `"   " + emojiMap['N']` -> `"   ðŸŸ¦"`

#### Step 3: Assemble the Final String

Now, combine the lines with newline characters (`\n`).

```
ChromaCross #42
Solved in 9 guesses (2 incorrect)
   ðŸŸ§
â¬œðŸŸ©ðŸŸ¨ðŸŸ«ðŸŸ¥
   ðŸŸª
   â¬›
   ðŸŸ¦
#ChromaCross
```

This looks much better! It preserves the shape, it's compact, and it's intriguing. It makes someone else ask, "What are the rules of that game?"

### Code Logic Implementation

Here is how you could structure the function in JavaScript:

```javascript
function generateShareText(puzzle, gameState) {
  const title = `ChromaCross #${puzzle.puzzleId}`;
  const attempts =
    gameState.revealedLetters.length + gameState.incorrectGuesses.length;
  const summary = `Solved in ${attempts} guesses (${gameState.incorrectGuesses.length} incorrect)`;

  // This map would be defined elsewhere, maybe even with the puzzle
  const emojiMap = { /* ... as above ... */ };

  let gridText = "";
  const horizontalWord = puzzle.words.horizontal;
  const verticalWord = puzzle.words.vertical;
  const hIndex = puzzle.intersection.horizontalIndex; // 3
  const vIndex = puzzle.intersection.verticalIndex; // 1

  // 1. Top part of vertical word
  for (let i = 0; i < vIndex; i++) {
    const letter = verticalWord[i];
    const padding = " ".repeat(hIndex);
    gridText += `${padding}${emojiMap[letter]}\n`;
  }

  // 2. Horizontal word
  for (let i = 0; i < horizontalWord.length; i++) {
    const letter = horizontalWord[i];
    gridText += emojiMap[letter];
  }
  gridText += "\n";

  // 3. Bottom part of vertical word
  for (let i = vIndex + 1; i < verticalWord.length; i++) {
    const letter = verticalWord[i];
    const padding = " ".repeat(hIndex);
    gridText += `${padding}${emojiMap[letter]}\n`;
  }

  return `${title}\n${summary}\n${gridText.trim()}\n#ChromaCross`;
}
```
This detailed approach ensures the output is consistent, visually appealing, and correctly represents the unique layout of each day's puzzle.

Updates:
You are absolutely right. The side-by-side table format is great for a visual comparison but terrible for clarity if you try to copy the text. My apologies for that. It's a classic case of a format not matching the context of use.

Here are the corrected instructions, rewritten in clean, standard Markdown for clarity and ease of use.

## Dynamic Share Functionality: A Better Approach

The core problem with the previous logic was that a shared result looked the same regardless of a win or a loss, which is uninteresting. The shared text should be a unique "fingerprint" of the player's game.

### The Guiding Principle

The shared grid must visually represent the outcome of the game:
*   **A WIN** is a trophy. It should display the perfect, complete puzzle grid using all the color emojis.
*   **A LOSS** is a progress report. It should show which letters the player successfully found (in color) and which they missed (as neutral gray squares).

### On a Successful WIN

**Goal:** Display the perfect solution.

If the player wins, the grid is generated using the color emoji for every single letter in the puzzle.

**Example Output (WIN):**

```text
ChromaCross #42
Solved in 10 guesses (1 incorrect)
   ðŸŸ§
â¬œðŸŸ©ðŸŸ¨ðŸŸ«ðŸŸ¥
   ðŸŸª
   â¬›
   ðŸŸ¦
#ChromaCross
```

### On a LOSS

**Goal:** Display a map of the player's knowledge at the end of the game.

If the player loses, the grid is a hybrid.
*   For letters the player correctly guessed, use the corresponding color emoji.
*   For letters the player **did not guess**, use a neutral gray emoji, like `ðŸ”³`.

**Example Scenario (LOSS):**
Imagine the puzzle is `WATER`/`LEMON`. The player loses, having only found the letters **W, A, E,** and **N**.

**Example Output (LOSS):**

```text
ChromaCross #42 - Lost
Found 4/9 letters
   ðŸ”³
â¬œðŸŸ©ðŸ”³ðŸŸ«ðŸ”³
   ðŸ”³
   ðŸ”³
   ðŸŸ¦
#ChromaCross
```
This tells a much more interesting story. You can see exactly which parts of the puzzle remained a mystery.

### Implementation Logic

The `generateShareText` function must be updated to handle these two different states.

```javascript
function generateShareText(puzzle, gameState) {
  const title = `ChromaCross #${puzzle.puzzleId}`;
  let summary = "";
  let gridText = "";
  const graySquare = "ðŸ”³"; // Emoji for unguessed letters on loss

  // This map would be defined elsewhere, maybe with the puzzle
  const emojiMap = {
    W: "â¬œ", A: "ðŸŸ©", T: "ðŸŸ¨", E: "ðŸŸ«", R: "ðŸŸ¥",
    L: "ðŸŸ§", M: "ðŸŸª", O: "â¬›", N: "ðŸŸ¦",
  };

  const horizontalWord = puzzle.words.horizontal;
  const verticalWord = puzzle.words.vertical;
  const hIndex = puzzle.intersection.horizontalIndex;
  const vIndex = puzzle.intersection.verticalIndex;

  // --- Main Logic Branch ---
  if (gameState.status === "WON") {
    const attempts =
      gameState.revealedLetters.length + gameState.incorrectGuesses.length;
    summary = `Solved in ${attempts} guesses (${gameState.incorrectGuesses.length} incorrect)`;

    // Build the grid with all colors
    gridText = buildGrid(letter => emojiMap[letter]);
  } else if (gameState.status === "LOST") {
    summary = `Found ${gameState.revealedLetters.length}/${puzzle.uniqueLetters.length} letters`;
    const revealed = gameState.revealedLetters;

    // Build the grid, checking if each letter was revealed
    gridText = buildGrid(letter =>
      revealed.includes(letter) ? emojiMap[letter] : graySquare,
    );
  }

  // Helper function to avoid repeating grid construction logic
  function buildGrid(getEmojiForLetter) {
    let text = "";
    const padding = " ".repeat(hIndex);

    // Top part of vertical word
    for (let i = 0; i < vIndex; i++) {
      text += `${padding}${getEmojiForLetter(verticalWord[i])}\n`;
    }

    // Horizontal word
    for (let i = 0; i < horizontalWord.length; i++) {
      text += getEmojiForLetter(horizontalWord[i]);
    }
    text += "\n";

    // Bottom part of vertical word
    for (let i = vIndex + 1; i < verticalWord.length; i++) {
      text += `${padding}${getEmojiForLetter(verticalWord[i])}\n`;
    }
    return text.trim();
  }

  return `${title}\n${summary}\n${gridText}\n#ChromaCross`;
}
```
